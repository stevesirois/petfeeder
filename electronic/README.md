# PCB Board and electronic components

This board and circuit was design with Autocad Eagle version 9.6.2

The design is quite straight forward with a couple of MOSFET transistor acting as logic level booster since the Arduino Nano 33 IOT operate at 3.3V.

This PCB board can be easily produce by using site as https://jlcpcb.com/ or https://oshpark.com/ . Just follow the instructions on their site to produce the required output files.
