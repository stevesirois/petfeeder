## Concerning the model...

This is my first _big_ project with FreeCad so, along the way, you will find the bad, the good and the ugly!  
I tried a lot of things (parametric sheet, datum plane, shape binder, etc.) during this project so there is some part that will be more stable if you tried to tweak them and other that will fall apart instantaneously (the dreaded topological naming problem in freecad). Freecad is a vast software where you can do things in a zillion ways and I'm still learning the "best" way. Hopefully you will find some interesting stuff and any comments is welcome.

Special hats off to the FreeCad forum community (https://forum.freecadweb.org/). I found answers to my newbie questions as fast as I can type respond and there is highly knowledgeable people than will be happy to help you!
